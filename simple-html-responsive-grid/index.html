        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
        text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from
        45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
        more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
        and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
        discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
        of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
        on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
        first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes
        from a line in section 1.10.32.
        <p>
        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
        for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum
        et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
        accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
