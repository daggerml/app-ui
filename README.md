## Overview

This site is mostly vibe coded. You'll notice some nonsensical logic internally
because of this. If you're trying to implement new functionality, I suggest
using an LLM to understand the logic and flow. If you want to build a robust UI,
I suggest starting from scratch (maybe just grepping this repo for whatever bits
you find useful).
